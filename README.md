### CURRENT OBJECTIVE - DRIVING SCHOOLS | RESUME DEVLEOPMENT

## 📖 Overview

This repository is the **Self-Mastery Command Center** of Hanes — a personal project to evolve into the highest version of himself: **Solis**.

**Solis** is the refined future: a cybersecurity leader, a man of wealth, class, power, generosity, mastery, and legacy. This repo contains structured systems, rituals, reflections, and growth architecture to engineer that reality through **deliberate self-sculpting**.

This is not a productivity project.  
This is a **personal declaration of war on mediocrity**.
