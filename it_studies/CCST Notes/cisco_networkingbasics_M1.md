## üìå Summary

This module introduces the **different types of networks**, from small home setups to global systems. It categorizes **mobile devices**, **home automation gadgets**, and other **IoT-connected tools**. It also explains **how data travels** through these networks‚Äîelectrically, optically, or wirelessly. Essential metrics such as **bandwidth and throughput** are clarified to ensure you understand not just what‚Äôs connected, but how efficiently it communicates.

## ‚úÖ Key Points to Remember

- **SOHO** stands for Small Office/Home Office.
- Medium and large networks require **advanced infrastructure** (e.g., routers, VLANs).
- Mobile devices range from phones to smartwatches and glasses‚Äîeach with unique capabilities.
- Home and other connected devices are part of the **Internet of Things (IoT)**.
- Data transmission occurs via **electrical (copper)**, **optical (fiber)**, and **wireless** mediums.
- **Bandwidth** is the maximum data capacity; **Throughput** is the actual transfer rate.
- **Latency** affects throughput‚Äî**lower latency = faster response**.
- RFID, sensors, actuators, and smart cars are **non-traditional devices** that are still network-enabled.
