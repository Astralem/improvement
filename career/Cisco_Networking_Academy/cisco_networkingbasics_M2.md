## 💻 Host Roles in a Network

In modern computer networks, a **host** (any connected device) can function as:

- ✅ **Client**
- ✅ **Server**
- ✅ **Both** — depending on the software installed

---

## 🖥️ What is a Server?

A **server** is a host that runs specialized software to provide services to other hosts (clients).

### 🔧 Common Server Roles:
- 🌐 **Web Server** – Delivers webpages
- 📧 **Email Server** – Sends, receives, and stores email
- 📂 **File Server** – Shares files across a network

> ⚠️ Each role requires separate server software.

---

## 👨‍💻 What is a Client?

A **client** is a host that **requests** and **displays** information or services from a server.

### 💡 Examples of Client Software:
- 🌐 **Web Browsers** (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
- 📧 **Email Clients** (e.g., Outlook, Thunderbird)

---

## 🔁 Server–Client Interaction Example

1. The **client** launches a browser.
2. The browser **sends a request** to a **web server**.
3. The server **responds with the webpage**.
4. The browser **displays** the content to the user.

📩 With email:  
The **email client** connects to the **email server**, sending and receiving messages.

## 🤝 Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Networks

In a **P2P network**, each device acts as **both client and server**.

### ✅ Advantages:
- Easy to set up
- Less complex
- Lower cost (no dedicated server needed)
- Ideal for simple file sharing or printer access

### ❌ Disadvantages:
- No central administration
- Less secure
- Poor scalability
- Shared roles can affect device performance

---

## 🧩 End Devices

End devices provide **user interfaces** to the network.

### Examples:
- 💻 Computers
- 🖨️ Network Printers
- ☎️ Telephones
- 📷 Security Cameras
- 📱 Mobile Devices

---

## 🌐 Internet Service Providers (ISPs)

An **ISP** connects a home or office network to the wider **Internet**.

### Services Offered:
- 🖥️ Web Hosting
- 📁 FTP Hosting
- 🎞️ Media & App Hosting
- 🏢 Equipment Co-location
- 📡 Point-of-Presence (POP) Internet Access
- 📞 Voice over IP (VoIP)
- 🛠️ Technical Support

---

## 🔌 Cable & DSL Connections

### 📡 Cable Internet
- Uses **coaxial cable** to deliver internet data.
- Typically faster download speeds.

### 📞 DSL (Digital Subscriber Line)
- Uses **telephone lines** divided into 3 channels:
  - 📞 Voice Calls
  - 📥 Fast Downloading
  - 📤 Uploading Data

✅ Allows simultaneous phone use and internet access.

---

## 📶 Additional Connectivity Options

### 📱 Cellular
- Connects to cell towers (3G, 4G, 5G).
- Common for mobile devices and hotspots.

### 🛰️ Satellite
- Uses **dish antennas** to connect to orbiting satellites.
- Often used in rural or remote areas.

### ☎️ Dial-Up
- Connects via traditional phone lines.
- Very slow and outdated.

---

## 📌 Key Takeaways

- Hosts can be clients, servers, or both, depending on the software.
- Clients request services; servers respond with resources.
- Peer-to-peer networks are simpler but less secure and scalable.
- End devices serve as access points between users and networks.
- ISPs offer the bridge to the internet and other services.
- Internet access can be achieved via cable, DSL, cellular, satellite, or even dial-up (legacy).

---

## 🧠 Summary

This module covered the fundamental components and roles within a computer network.  
You now understand:

- The distinction between **clients** and **servers**
- How **P2P networks** operate
- What **end devices** are and their purpose
- The role of an **ISP** and the services they offer
- Common **connection types** (Cable, DSL, Cellular, Satellite)
