# ðŸ“˜ MODULE 6: NETWORK MEIDA

Communication in a network relies on **media**â€”the physical or wireless channel through which data is transmitted from **source to destination**.

---

## ðŸ§± Types of Network Media

Modern networks primarily use **three types of transmission media**:

### 1. ðŸ§² Metal Wires (Copper Cables)
- **Data Encoding:** Electrical impulses
- **Example:** Twisted-pair (Ethernet), Coaxial cable

### 2. ðŸ’¡ Fiber-Optic Cables
- **Data Encoding:** Pulses of light
- **Materials:** Glass or plastic fibers (hair-thin)
- **Advantage:** Immune to electromagnetic interference, ideal for high-speed and long-distance data

### 3. ðŸ“¡ Wireless Transmission
- **Data Encoding:** Modulation of radio/microwave frequencies
- **Application:** Wi-Fi, cellular, satellite, Bluetooth

## ðŸ“Š Criteria for Choosing Network Media

When selecting media, four key factors must be considered:

| Criteria                        | Description                                                                 |
|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Distance**                   | Maximum range over which data remains intact and readable                   |
| **Environment**                | Suitability based on conditions (indoor/outdoor, interference, etc.)        |
| **Bandwidth and Speed**       | Amount and speed of data that must be transmitted                           |
| **Cost**                      | Budget for both initial installation and maintenance                        |

## ðŸ§µ Common Cable Types

### ðŸ”¹ Twisted-Pair Cable (Ethernet)
- Most widely used in local area networks (LAN)
- Carries electrical signals via copper wires
- Types: UTP (Unshielded), STP (Shielded)

### ðŸ”¸ Coaxial Cable
- Used in cable TV and satellite systems
- Single copper conductor with shielding
- Reliable over medium distances

### ðŸ”¸ Fiber-Optic Cable
- Uses light for data transmission
- Extremely fast and resistant to interference
- Ideal for long-distance and high-bandwidth communication

| Media Type      | Transmission | Distance    | Interference | Speed       | Cost     |
|-----------------|--------------|-------------|--------------|-------------|----------|
| Twisted-Pair    | Electrical   | Short/Med   | Moderate     | Moderate    | Low      |
| Coaxial         | Electrical   | Medium      | Low          | Moderate    | Moderate |
| Fiber-Optic     | Light        | Long        | None         | Very High   | High     |
| Wireless        | EM Waves     | Variable    | High         | Variable    | Low-Med  |
