## 💻 Host Roles in a Network

In modern computer networks, a **host** (any connected computer) can act as a:

- ✅ **Client**
- ✅ **Server**
- ✅ **Both** — depending on the software installed

---

## 🖥️ What is a Server?

A **server** is a host with specific **server software** that provides services to other hosts on the network.

### 🔧 Common Server Roles:
- 🌐 **Web Server** – Delivers webpages
- 📧 **Email Server** – Sends and stores email
- 📂 **File Server** – Shares files and directories

> ⚠️ **Each type of service** requires separate **server software**.

## 👨‍💻 What is a Client?

A **client** is a host with software that **requests and displays** information from a server.

### 💡 Examples of Client Software:
- **Web Browsers** (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari)
  - Requests webpages from a **web server**
- **Email Clients** (e.g., Microsoft Outlook)
  - Sends and receives messages via an **email server**

---

## 🔁 Interaction Example

1. The **client** (user) opens a browser.
2. The browser **requests** a webpage from a **web server**.
3. The **web server** responds with the webpage content.
4. The **client** displays the webpage to the user.

Similarly:
- An email client like Outlook requests email from a mail server.
- It can **send and receive** messages using client-server communication.

## Peer-to-peer networks
- **Acts as both Clients AND Servers.**

Advantages
- Easy to set up
- Less complex
- Lower cost because network devices and dedicated servers may not be required
- Can be used for simple tasks such as transferring files and sharing printers

Disadvantages 
- No centralized administration
- Not as secure
- Not scalable
- All devices may act as both clients and servers which can slow their performance
